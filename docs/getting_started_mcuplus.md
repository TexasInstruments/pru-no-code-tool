# Getting Started with MCU+ SDK

</div>

[Install the MCU+ SDK](#install-the-mcu-sdk)  
[Install the tools](#install-the-tools)  
[Set up imports.mak](#set-up-importsmak)  

## Install the MCU+ SDK

Users can either install the prebuilt MCU+ SDK :
   * The prebuilt SDK is packaged specifically for a single device, so it takes
     up less hard drive space than the MCU+ SDK repo
   * The CCS files in the pru-no-code-tool project need modification to work with the
     MCU+ SDK repository

**The prebuilt MCU+ SDK**
installer can be downloaded here:
   - [AM243x MCU+ SDK](https://www.ti.com/tool/download/MCU-PLUS-SDK-AM243X)
   - [AM64x MCU+ SDK](https://www.ti.com/tool/download/MCU-PLUS-SDK-AM64X)
   - [AM261x MCU+ SDK](https://www.ti.com/tool/download/MCU-PLUS-SDK-AM261X)

## Install the tools

> [!NOTE]
> Refer to the documentation associated with your specific SDK release

Install the versions of the tools that are listed in these pages:
   - MCU+ SDK docs > Getting Started > Download, Install, and Setup SDK and Tools
   - MCU+ SDK docs > Getting Started > Download, Install, and Setup CCS
     - Developers using a Linux computer, make sure to follow the additional steps at "CCS Linux Host Support"

## Set up imports.mak

The imports.mak file contains the information that the pru-no-code-tool makefiles need
in order to build on your computer.

### Copy the default file

Copy `pru-no-code-tool/imports.mak.default` into a new file, `pru-no-code-tool/imports.mak`.

For ease of use, the new imports.mak file is already excluded from git tracking.

### Customize imports.mak for your computer

Open imports.mak and update the settings based on your specific computer. Follow
the `UPDATE` comments to see which settings need to be modified.

## Next steps

After the pru-no-code-tool repository has been set up, refer back to the
[README](./../README.md) for build steps.
